This is a "dehasher" tool that looks through all the word combinations, hashes them and outputs the raw word that has the same hash as the given input.
Dehashing works on the following hashing methods: MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384 and SHA512.
The dehasher uses Python's hashlib module. More info can be found at https://docs.python.org/3/library/hashlib.html
